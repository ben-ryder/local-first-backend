# Localful
A client toolkit and optional server for developing local-first web apps with versioned content, client-side encryption, cross-device sync and cloud storage. 

## ‚ùì What is "versioned content"?
Versioned content is content that is stored and managed using immutable versions, meaning that every time you edit content a new version is created which contains all data required to represent that content.
This very simplistic storage method allows for version history and a basic form of concurrent editing, as multiple versions
can be created simultaneously and synced later without fear of conflicts as each version is distinct and immutable.

"Content" is used here generically, and could refer to anything depending on your application. Localful is built to use client-side encryption so
applications control how they want to integrate with Localful. 

## üõ†Ô∏è What does this project include?
This project includes:
- A self-hostable Node.js server which...
  - Provides cloud storage and cross-device synchronisation via a HTTP API and Websockets.
  - Implements a user and authentication system, allowing multiple users to sign up and use the same server (new user registration can be disabled if required)
- A Javascript SDK library (currently web only) which...
  - Provides functionality to integrate with the server and manage content.
  - Implements client-side encryption, which you can learn more about in the **[encryption specification](./docs/local/encryption/specification.md)**.
  - Implements local persistence via IndexDB.

To learn when this project may or may not be useful to you, check out the **[use cases docs](./docs/use-cases.md)**.  
You can also take a look at **[minimal and real-world example apps](./docs/examples.md)** using Localful Versioned.  

## üå± A focus on simplicity, interoperability and longevity
Localful has no built-in conflict resolution features that you might get with more advanced systems that utilise CRDTs or distributed databases, and you also pay a much higher storage and network cost as you are
required to send and store more data. This makes Localful most suited to use cases where:
- The focus is on a single user editing their own content
- Users still want to back up their content to the cloud and sync it between their own devices, but instant real-time collaboration between users and devices isn't a huge priority
- The content being created is generally not super large, and edits don't need to be tracked at the most granular level possible
- There is no requirement for automagically resolving or merging changes. If a user creates two or more content versions simultaneously, all versions are synced between all devices and a last-write-wins method is used to select the
most recent version as the current state of the content.

The advantages of using versioned content are simplicity, interoperability and longevity:
- **Simplicity**: There is no need for complex algorithms to handle things like eventual consistency, conflict resolution etc. This makes your application predictable and easy to reason about for developers and more importantly, for **users**.
- **Interoperability**: The server implements a straightforward HTTP API and Websocket system and each version contains all data for that content. This means you don't have to rely on special specifications and protocols that may only be useful as long as maintained implementation exist, and the simplicity of the data storage method makes it easily compatible with anywhere you want to interact with that data.
- **Longevity**: Storing content on the client and server as versions that contain all content data means you are not committing to using a specialised storage system that could prove hard to migrate away from in the future and/or requires implementations for everywhere you want to access that data. 

### üìâ Reducing Network and Storage Costs
The network cost of sending versions with all content data again for every content edit will always be higher than many alternative systems that only send changes/deltas, however storage use can be kept under control by automatically deleting old versions based on when they were created and/or if there are over a given number of newer versions.  
You could even automatically delete all old versions from clients, and only retrieve these from the server if the use desires it.  

The frequency of version creation (and therefore the number of versions and network requests) can also be reduced by not implementing features such as automatic saving into your application, or by implementing this by only creating a 
new version of content after a period of inactivity. This means content edits would not be captured at their most granular level, but that is a required trade-off to prevent the network and storage costs quickly become unsustainable.
