## Overview
Localful works by storing data in immutable versions, where each edit a user makes creates a new version.  
This very simplistic storage method allows for version history and a basic form of concurrent editing, as multiple versions can be created simultaneously and synced without fear of conflicts as each version is distinct and immutable. All versions are synced between all devices and a last-write-wins method is used to select the most recent version as the current state of the data.

This system makes Localful most suited to use cases where:
- The focus is on a single user editing their own content (although data sharing and collaberation featrues may come in the future).
- You want to back up data to a central server and sync it between devices, but instant real-time collaboration between users and devices isn't critical to your apps experience.
- The data being created is generally not super large, as creating new versions for every edit does increase storage and network costs.
- Data edits don't need to be tracked at the most granular level possible.
- There is no requirement for automagically resolving or merging changes.
