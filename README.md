# Localful
There are lots of tools and libraries to help you develop local-first web applications, however these often require building around CRDTs, eventual consistency, conflict resolution and other concepts 
which fundementally change how you build apps, and how you store and manage data.  
These concepts are incredibly powerful and useful when needed, but introduce a world of compexity when your use case doesn't require them.

Localful provides a practical "good enough" way of building local-first web apps, with a focus on simplicity, interoperability and longevity

## ‚ùì How does it work?
Localful works by creating immutable versions of content, where each version contains all data required to represent that content.  

There is a much higher storage and network cost to persist and send these versions, but this very simplistic storage method allows for
version history and a basic form of concurrent editing, as multiple versions can be created simultaneously and synced later without fear
of conflicts as each version is distinct and immutable.  
If a user creates two or more content versions simultaneously, all versions are synced between all devices and a last-write-wins method is used to select the
most recent version as the current state of the content.

These tradeofs makes Localful most suited to use cases where:
- The focus is on a single user editing their own content
- Users still want to back up their content to the cloud and sync it between their own devices, but instant real-time collaboration between users and devices isn't critical to your apps experience
- The content being created is generally not super large, and edits don't need to be tracked at the most granular level possible
- There is no requirement for automagically resolving or merging changes.

## üõ†Ô∏è What does this project include?
- A Javascript SDK library (currently web only) which...
  - Implements local persistence via IndexDB
    - Define and validate your content schema using [Zod](https://zod.dev/)
    - Primative support for data and schema migrations
    - Reactive queries via [RxJS observables](https://rxjs.dev/).
  - Implements client-side encryption, which you can learn more about in the **[encryption specification](./docs/local/encryption/specification.md)**.
  - Provides functionality to integrate with the server, including user management and content syncronisation.
- A self-hostable Node.js server which...
  - Provides cloud storage and cross-device synchronisation via a HTTP API and Websockets.
  - Implements a user and authentication system, allowing multiple users to sign up and use the same server (new user registration can be disabled if required)

## üå± A focus on simplicity, interoperability and longevity
What does it mean to say that Localful focuses on simplicity, interoperability and longevity?

- **Simplicity**: There is no need for complex algorithms to handle things like eventual consistency, conflict resolution etc. This makes your application predictable and easy to reason about for developers and more importantly, for **users**.
- **Interoperability**: The server implements a straightforward HTTP API and Websocket system and each version contains all content data. This means you don't have to rely on special specifications and protocols that may only be useful as long as maintained implementation exist, and you can consume and write data easily using any technology.
- **Longevity**: Storing content on the client and server as versions that contain all content data means you are not committing to using a specialised storage format that could prove hard to migrate away from in the future and/or requires implementations for everywhere you want to access that data. 

### üìâ Reducing Network and Storage Costs
The network cost of sending versions with all content data for every edit will always be higher than many alternative systems that only send changes/deltas, however storage use can be kept under control by automatically deleting old versions based on when they were created and/or if there are over a given number of newer versions. You could even automatically delete all old versions from clients, and only retrieve these from the server if the use desires it.  

The frequency of version creation (and therefore the number of versions and network requests) can also be reduced by not implementing features such as automatic saving into your application, or by implementing this by only creating a new version of content after a period of inactivity.  
This means content edits would not be captured at their most granular level, but that is a required trade-off to prevent the network and storage costs quickly become unsustainable.
